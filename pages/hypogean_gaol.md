# [Hypogean Gaol](@) {#:id}
`:?` To get here, you must be killed by a [Kidnapper]. [Kidnapper]s start appearing after killing [Blood-starved Beast] (in [Old Yharnam]), and one is at the bottom of the straight stairs in [Cathedral Ward].
`:i` [Hypogean Gaol] is an optionally accessible part of an end-game area called [Yahar'gul, Unseen Village]. You only have access to a small part of it (and with less dangerous enemies), until [Blood Moon]. It can be worth visiting: the [Kidnappers] near the [lamp] drop [Twin Shard]s and 1500 [blood echoes] each, and the one-directional shortcut doors you can now open will let you exit the church safely during [Blood Moon]. Also, encountering [Darkbeast Paarl] turns [Djura] back in [Old Yharnam] non-hostile, letting you talk to him.
