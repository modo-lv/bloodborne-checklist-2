#### [Abandoned Old Workshop](@) {#:id}
:? Make your way into the lower tower — the dark pit with the wood beams and platforms. At the very entrance, there is a short, broken off beam coming out of the left side of the platform going towards the center of the pit. You must drop between that beam and the edge of the platform that's built along the wall. You will land on a wooden beam, from which you should be able to see another platform below you with the door leading to the workshop. Make sure you have enough health to survive the long drops.
