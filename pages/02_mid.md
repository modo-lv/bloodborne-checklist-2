### [Hypogean Gaol](@) {#:id}
:? To get here, you must be killed by a [Kidnapper]. [Kidnapper]s start appearing after killing [Blood-starved Beast] (in [Old Yharnam]), and one is at the bottom of the straight stairs in [Cathedral Ward].
:i [Hypogean Gaol] is part of an end-game area called [Yahar'gul, Unseen Village]. You only have access to about half of it, and with less dangerous enemies, until [Blood Moon]. It can be worth visiting, though: the [Kidnappers] near the [lamp] drop [Twin Shard]s and 1500 [blood echoes] each, and the one-directional doors you can now open will let you exit the church after [Blood Moon] when it contains more dangerous enemies. Also, encountering [Darkbeast Paarl] turns [Djura] back in [Old Yharnam] non-hostile, letting you talk to him.
