### Inner [Cathedral Ward] {#:id}
:::{:help}
The most direct way to access this part of the [Cathedral Ward] is to purchase [Hunter Chief Emblem] from the [Messenger Bath] in [Hunter's Dream] (10000 blood echoes) and use it on the main gate (up the winding stairway).
But you can also go the long way around: head to [Old Yharnam] & defeat the [Blood-Starved Beast], which will unlock [Upper Cathedral Ward], allowing you to reach the plaza through a back way and open all gates from the inside.
