# [Hunter's Dream](@) {#:id}
You begin the game in [1st Floor Sickroom], but Hunter's Dream is your base of operations where you return to level up, upgrade your weapons, teleport between lamps and so on.

- Choose right hand weapon
  :i If you don't know what to pick, pick [Hunter Axe]. It has the highest damage and health recovery, and its two-handed fully charged heavy attack not only hits twice, but also knocks down any non-giant enemy (including [Huntsman's Minion]s and [Executioner]s) if it connects. [Threaded Cane] is the weakest of the weapons, and the [Saw Cleaver] is almost identical to the [Saw Spear] that you can pick up in [Central Yharnam]'s [Dry Dock].
- Choose left hand weapon
  :i Despite the descriptions, the [Hunter Blunderbuss] isn't any slower than the [Hunter Pistol], the main difference is in the firing distance and damage. The blunderbuss works like a shotgun â€” it's more likely to hit & stagger close up, but simply can't reach as far as the pistol (and does less damage at medium distance, although firearm damage isn't really a factor in Bloodborne unless you build your character specifically for it).
