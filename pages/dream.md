# [Hunter's Dream](@) {#:id}
You begin the game in [Iosefka's Clinic], but Hunter's Dream is your base of operations where you return to level up, upgrade your weapons, teleport between lamps and so on.

+ `w` Choose right hand weapon
  :::{:i}
  * **[Hunter Axe]**: If you don't know what to pick, pick this. It has the highest damage and health recovery, and its two-handed fully charged heavy attack not only hits twice, but also knocks down any non-giant enemy (including [Huntsman's Minion]s and [Executioner]s).
  * **[Threaded Cane]** is the weakest of the three weapons, not recommended for first time players.
  * **[Saw Cleaver]** is almost identical to the [Saw Spear] that you can pick up in [Central Yharnam]'s [Dry Dock].

  `:i` Despite the descriptions, the [Hunter Blunderbuss] isn't any slower than the [Hunter Pistol], the main difference is in the firing distance and damage. The blunderbuss works like a shotgun â€” it's more likely to hit & stagger close up, but simply can't reach as far as the pistol (and does less damage at medium distance, although firearm damage isn't really a factor in Bloodborne unless you build your character specifically for it).
